# Anemoi Inference Gateway Guide

The Anemoi Inference Gateway (added in issue #34) provides an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that intelligently selects which model to use for each request.

## What is the Inference Gateway?

Instead of:
```json
{
  "model": "qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp",
  "messages": [...]
}
```

You can send:
```json
{
  "model": "coding",
  "messages": [...]
}
```

And Anemoi will:
1. **Decide** which model to use (qwen3.6-35b, qwen3.5-9b, gemma-4, etc.)
2. **Forward** your request to that model
3. **Stream** the response back with decision telemetry

---

## Available Endpoints

### List Models

**Endpoint**: `GET /v1/models`

**Request**:
```bash
curl http://anemoi.home.arpa/v1/models
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "coding",
      "object": "model",
      "owned_by": "anemoi",
      "anemoi_domain": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The `anemoi_domain` flag indicates this is a governance domain (not a raw model).

### Chat Completions

**Endpoint**: `POST /v1/chat/completions`

**Request**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://anemoi.home.arpa/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "coding",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "stream": false
  }'
```

**Response** (non-streaming):
```json
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-ABCD1234...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1780090362,
  "model": "qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "2 + 2 = 4"
      },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 17,
    "completion_tokens": 11,
    "total_tokens": 28
  }
}
```

**Response Headers**:
```
X-Anemoi-Decision-Id: d-abc123xyz
X-Anemoi-Selected-Model: qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp
X-Anemoi-Action: forward-to-runtime
```

**Streaming** (SSE format):
```bash
curl -X POST http://anemoi.home.arpa/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "coding",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

Response streams as SSE:
```
data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"!"},"finish_reason":null}]}
data: [DONE]
```

## How It Works: The Decision Engine

### Step 1: Request Arrives

```json
{
  "model": "coding",
  "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
  "max_tokens": 100
}
```

### Step 2: Anemoi Inspects Runtime

Anemoi checks the current state:
```
Runtime State:
  qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp: hot_gpu (GPU loaded, 65% VRAM)
  qwen3.5-9b: hot_gpu (GPU loaded, 30% VRAM)  
  gemma-4-26b-a4b-it: loading (being loaded now)
  
Active Requests:
  qwen3.6-35b: 2 requests
  qwen3.5-9b: 0 requests
```

### Step 3: Score Candidates

For each available model:
```
Score = policy_weight * (
  resource_pressure +
  latency_cost +
  capability_match
)

qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp:
  - VRAM pressure: 65% (acceptable)
  - Active requests: 2 (busy but manageable)
  - Capability: Excellent for code (+10 points)
  - Score: 85

qwen3.5-9b:
  - VRAM pressure: 30% (plenty available)
  - Active requests: 0 (idle)
  - Capability: Good for code (+5 points)  
  - Score: 78

gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:
  - VRAM pressure: Still loading...
  - Score: 0 (not available yet)
```

### Step 4: Select Winner

qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp wins with score 85.

### Step 5: Forward Request

```
Original:  {"model": "coding", ...}
Rewritten: {"model": "qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp", ...}
Auth: Inject llama-swap API key
Forward to: http://llama-swap.home.arpa:8000/v1/chat/completions
```

### Step 6: Stream Response

Response streams back with telemetry headers:
```
X-Anemoi-Decision-Id: d-abc123xyz  (for audit trail)
X-Anemoi-Selected-Model: qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp  (what was selected)
X-Anemoi-Action: forward-to-runtime  (what anemoi did)
```

### Step 7: Record Decision

Anemoi logs to SQLite:
```
Decision ID: d-abc123xyz
Domain: coding
Selected Model: qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp
Selected At: 2026-05-30T14:23:45.123Z
Latency: 47ms
Runtime: remote
Status: success
```

## Request Parameters

The gateway supports all standard OpenAI parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| `model` | string | required | Governance domain (e.g., "coding") |
| `messages` | array | required | Chat messages |
| `temperature` | float | 0.7 | Randomness (0.0-2.0) |
| `top_p` | float | 0.9 | Nucleus sampling |

**Note**: Not all parameters are supported by all underlying runtimes. Unsupported parameters are silently ignored.

---

## Response Telemetry

Every response includes headers with decision info:

### X-Anemoi-Decision-Id
Unique identifier for this decision. Use to query the event store:

```bash
sqlite3 anemoi-events.db \
  "SELECT * FROM decisions WHERE id = 'd-abc123xyz';"
```

### X-Anemoi-Selected-Model
The actual model that was selected and ran your request.

Examples:
- `qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp`
- `qwen3.5-9b`
- `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`

### X-Anemoi-Action
What anemoi did with your request:

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `forward-to-runtime` | Request forwarded to actual runtime (live) |
| `mock-forward` | Request simulated (testing mode) |
| `decision-only` | Decision made but not executed |

---

## Error Handling

### Invalid Domain

**Request**:
```json
{"model": "unknown-domain", "messages": [...]}
```

**Response** (400 Bad Request):
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Unknown domain: unknown-domain. Available: coding",
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "param": "model",
    "code": "invalid_value"
  }
}
```

### No Available Models

**Request**: When all models are unavailable/loading

**Response** (503 Service Unavailable):
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "No models available for domain: coding. All are loading or unavailable.",
    "type": "server_error",
    "code": "no_models_available"
  }
}
```

### Runtime Failure

**Request**: When the selected runtime fails

**Response** (502 Bad Gateway):
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Runtime error: Failed to reach llama-swap",
    "type": "server_error",
    "code": "runtime_unavailable"
  },
  "anemoi_decision_id": "d-abc123xyz"
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Code Generation

```bash
curl -X POST http://anemoi.home.arpa/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "coding",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Write a Python function to calculate factorial"
      }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 200
  }' | python -m json.tool
```

**What Happens**:
1. Anemoi checks: "Is this a code task? Yes → coding domain"
2. Inspects runtime: "Both qwen3.6 and qwen3.5 are available"
3. Scores: qwen3.6 is better for code (more capable)
4. Forwards request to qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp
5. Streams back: Python code for factorial function
6. Headers show: Selected qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp

### Example 2: Streaming Response

```bash
curl -X POST http://anemoi.home.arpa/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "coding",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "count to 5"}],
    "stream": true
  }' -N | while read -r line; do
    echo "$line"
  done
```

**Output** (SSE stream):
```
data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":"1"}}]}
data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"\n2"}}]}
data: {"choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"\n3"}}]}
...
data: [DONE]
```

### Example 3: Check Decision in Database

```bash
# Get decision ID from response headers
DECISION_ID="d-abc123xyz"

# Query what was recorded
sqlite3 anemoi-events.db \
  "SELECT domain, model, latency_ms, created_at FROM decisions WHERE id = '$DECISION_ID';"

# Output:
# coding|qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp|47|2026-05-30 14:23:45
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Anemoi (Direct Model Selection)

```
User: Select "qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp"
      ↓
Request: model=qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp
      ↓
If model is busy or out of memory: ERROR
      ↓
User must manually select a different model
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ Deterministic (same model every time)
- ❌ May fail if that model is busy
- ❌ Requires manual model management
- ❌ No audit trail of what was used

### After Anemoi (Governance Domain)

```
User: Select "Anemoi Governed Coding"
      ↓
Request: model=coding (governance domain)
      ↓
Anemoi Decision Engine:
  Check available models
  Score each one
  Select best fit
      ↓
Forward to selected model
      ↓
Response headers show which model was used
      ↓
Decision logged to SQLite
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Automatic (no manual model selection)
- ✅ Adaptive (picks best available model)
- ✅ Transparent (headers show what was selected)
- ✅ Auditable (all decisions logged)
- ✅ Intelligent (resource-aware scoring)

## Integration with Pi and OpenCode

### Pi Integration

1. **Install**: Copy `models.json` to `C:\Users\Alex Lucero\.pi\agent\`
2. **Restart**: Close and reopen Pi
3. **Select**: Choose "Anemoi Governed Coding" from dropdown
4. **Use**: Send requests as normal
5. **Check**: Look at `X-Anemoi-Selected-Model` header

### OpenCode Integration

Same steps as Pi:
1. **Install**: Copy `models.json` to `.opencode\`
2. **Restart**: Close and reopen OpenCode
3. **Select**: Choose "Anemoi Governed Coding" from dropdown
4. **Use**: Send requests as normal

## Performance Notes

### Decision Latency

Typical decision time: **30-100ms**

Breaking down:
- Runtime inspection: 20-80ms
- Scoring: 5-10ms
- Model selection: <1ms
- Total: 30-100ms

### Network Overhead

If reverse proxy adds latency:
- Consider direct localhost access
- Or use HTTP/2 for connection reuse

### Throughput

Single daemon can handle:
- **Mock mode**: 100+ requests/second
- **Live mode**: 50-100 requests/second (limited by runtime)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Request keeps selecting same model

**Problem**: Anemoi always picks the same model even if it's busy

**Solution**:
1. Check scoring weights in config
2. Verify load detection is working
3. Review decision explanation: `explain <decision-id>`

### Very slow decisions

**Problem**: Decision latency > 500ms

**Solution**:
1. Check if runtime is slow to inspect
2. Reduce `inspect_timeout_ms` in config
3. Consider enabling mock mode for testing

### Different model selected than expected

**Problem**: You expected one model but got another

**Solution**:
1. Use `explain <decision-id>` to see the scoring
2. Check runtime state: `cli residents`
3. Adjust policy weights if needed

---

## Monitoring

### Log Decisions

```bash
# Watch decisions in real-time
tail -f /var/log/anemoi.log | grep "Decision made"

# Count per model
tail -100 /var/log/anemoi.log | grep "Decision made" | awk -F'model:' '{print $2}' | sort | uniq -c
```

### Query Event Store

```bash
# Recent decisions
sqlite3 anemoi-events.db "SELECT id, model, latency_ms FROM decisions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;"

# Slowest decisions
sqlite3 anemoi-events.db "SELECT id, model, latency_ms FROM decisions ORDER BY latency_ms DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Most popular models
sqlite3 anemoi-events.db "SELECT model, COUNT(*) as count FROM decisions GROUP BY model ORDER BY count DESC;"
```

---

## Advanced: Custom Domains

Create new governance domains in `config/anemoi.yaml`:

```yaml
domains:
  coding:
    roster:
      - group: large_models
        models: ["qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp"]
      - group: small_models
        models: ["qwen3.5-9b"]
  
  chat:  # New domain
    roster:
      - group: conversational
        models: ["qwen3.6-35b-a3b-mtp", "gemma-4-26b-a4b-it"]
  
  summarize:  # Another new domain
    roster:
      - group: extractive
        models: ["qwen3.5-9b"]
```

Then use in requests:

```json
{"model": "chat", "messages": [...]}
{"model": "summarize", "messages": [...]}
```

Anemoi will independently score candidates for each domain.
